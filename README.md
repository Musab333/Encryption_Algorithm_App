Text Encryption Application

Introduction:

Text Encryption is a secure and user-friendly text encryption application designed to protect sensitive information by converting plain text into encrypted formats. This app ensures your messages remain private and accessible only to authorized users through an intuitive encryption and decryption process.

Features:

1. Input Original Text

Users can input any plain text, such as personal messages or confidential information.

2. Encrypt Text Using an Advanced Algorithm

The entered text is transformed into encrypted content through a secure encryption algorithm, ensuring the data remains protected and confidential.

3. Decrypt Encrypted Text to Original Format

Encrypted text can be reverted to its original form, enabling authorized users to access the message content.
